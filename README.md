# Business Insights - 360

## Project Background & Objectives
**Dataset source and context:** This is a guided project completed as part of the Codebasics, Data Analyst Bootcamp. 

## Overview
This is a Business performance report of  AtliQ hardware’s last 4 years' sales trends. I have designed a Power BI dashboard gathering sales data and assessed business performance on metrics (Net Sales, Gross Margin, Net Profit, Forecast Accuracy %, Net Error, Absolute Error). The Report details on Sales, Supply Chain, Marketing and Finance.

## Key Findings
 1. **Sales View:**
 - Customers with highest Gross margin % do not neccessarily have the highest Net Sales.  
 - Amazon for example has the highest Net sales and gross margin with only 36.78% gross margin %. (The maximum gross margin % is 48.55%). 
 - Nova, All-out, Unity Stores, Otto, Saturn, Billa and Notebillig on the other hand have least Net sales & Gross margin but not the least gross margin%.  
 - Amongst Segments of products, Networking have the least Net sales and Gross margin with the highest Gross margin %. 
 - In the North America Region, USA has the highest sales, India in APAC, UK in EU and Mexico in Latin America region. 

 2. **Finance View:**
 - November and December are peak seasons of sale. There year on year increase in sales has been commendable. The Post Covid Sales has been the highest in the 4 years.
 - In 2021, Net Profit % has been the highest and Gross margin % has been the least. 
 - EU & LATAM region has been consistently low performer in Gross Margin %. 
 - Even though Desktop category was a moderate performer in Total Sales, it has raked in good growth ever since its launch in 2020. Desktop and Notebook segments are performing exceptionally well. Networking is the only segment with a negative growth trend.

 3. **Marketing View:**
 - Notebook and Peripherals lead both in sales volume and profitability.
- Even low-volume segments like Networking and Storage contribute meaningfully, maintaining healthy profit percentages.

 4. **Supply Chain View:**
 - Notebook has the best combination of high forecast accuracy and moderate net error — great performance.
- Peripherals again show up with very high net error (338K) — needs urgent attention.
- Forecast Accuracy is consistently strong (avg ~81%), indicating a mature demand planning model. However, consistent negative Net Errors suggest a bias toward over-forecasting, risking excess stock or budget misallocation.

 5. **Executive View:** 
- N&S Division is the largest revenue segment.
- Distributor channels dominate sales, which may impact margin control and customer insights due to indirect interactions.
- AtiQ’s share increased steadily to 22.3% in 2022 EST — suggesting strong brand traction.
- Top-performing products are AI-driven, with strong margins — indicating good alignment with market demand.

## Strategic Recommendations

1. There is a need to re-assign gross margin % to the customers respective to their Business performance.  

2. While Gross Sales and Net Sales increased, so did costs (COGS and OpEx). 

3. Net Profit is negative and significantly worse than benchmark. Indicates poor cost control or overspending despite sales growth.

4. APAC and NA are major contributors. LATAM has very low P&L value — possibly an under-penetrated market.

5. While forecast accuracy is good, consistently negative net error implies systematic over-forecasting, which could lead to excess inventory or operational inefficiencies. Though the model is consistent, it may benefit from recalibration to reduce bias toward higher demand.

6. AtiQ is gaining market share consistently, closing the gap with established players. Branding and product strategy seem to be working effectively.

7. Revenue growth is strong, but margins are not growing at the same pace, pointing to potential cost pressure or price discounting.
